# Photolabs

PhotoLabs is a React-based single-page application (SPA) that allows users to view photos in different contexts.
This project was built as a part of my studies at Lighthouse Labs.

# Preview


# Features

 Users can like photos (a small alert icon is displayed in the navbar if there are any liked photos) and filter based on topic. 
 If a user is interested in a photo, they can click on it to view a larger version of the photo, along with a list of similar photos.
